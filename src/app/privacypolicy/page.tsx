            <strong>GPS Functionality:</strong> The RideNow platform utilizes the GPS functionality of the users&apos;
            phone to provide an efficient and personalized experience. The location information collected through GPS is
            used for multiple purposes essential to the operation of the service, such as calculating route distance and
            estimating trip rates, identifying and connecting Riders with nearby Drivers based on the user&apos;s
            geographic position, determining the most efficient route for each trip, and providing real-time updates on
            location and estimated time of arrival.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In addition, the GPS feature allows Drivers to track pick-up points designated by Riders, as well as ensure
            accurate and timely service. Location information is also used to generate internal reports and statistics
            improve service quality, optimize response times and contribute to the safety of the RideNow community.

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Right to be informed:</strong> Users of our platform will be informed, upon request, about what data

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Object:</strong> When we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained
            above, or in the public interest, you may object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases,
            we will stop processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate reasons to continue processing
            it or where it is necessary for legal reasons.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">

            storage of your information at any time. For example, you may withdraw your consent by updating your
            settings. In certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn your
            consent if we have a legal basis for doing so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain
            processing activities.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Complaint:</strong> If you wish to file a complaint about our use of your information (and without

            provide a copy of the automated processing activities we conduct if they believe that data is being
            unlawfully processed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Users or holders of personal data provided through the platform may exercise these rights over their
