            as Riders, can easily request rides, while Drivers can accept these requests and generate revenue by
            providing transportation services.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Our technology facilitates the interaction between those who need to get around and those who can provide
            that service, providing a space where users can coordinate rides to specific destinations in a safe and
            reliable manner. RideNow offers different transportation options, from economical alternatives to luxury
            services, adapting to different preferences and budgets to ensure a smooth and comfortable trip.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">

            and website. Both Riders and Drivers can enjoy an intuitive and practical tool that allows them to meet
            their transportation needs or generate revenue efficiently.

            <strong>5.1. Registration</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            To register as a Driver on the RideNow platform, it is necessary to complete a verification process designed
            to ensure safety and confidence in the services offered. Drivers must provide accurate and updated
            information, including personal data, specific details of their vehicle, and a valid copy of their
            driver&apos;s license. In addition, RideNow may request additional documents such as vehicle insurance,
            vehicle registration or other documentation required by local regulations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            As part of the process, all Drivers must undergo a background check. This evaluation is intended to confirm
            that Drivers meet the safety and ethical standards established by RideNow. Approval or denial of
            registration is at the discretion of RideNow, based on the results of the background check and compliance
            with our internal policies.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Once approved, Drivers must agree to keep their information and documentation up to date, notifying any
            relevant changes that may affect their eligibility to operate on the platform. The Driver account is
            personal and non-transferable, and the holder is solely responsible for its use, ensuring compliance with
            all applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            RideNow allows Drivers to deactivate their account at any time, without the need to justify their decision.
            Deactivation can be done through the tools available on the platform or by contacting RideNow technical
            support. However, any outstanding obligations, such as payments or resolutions related to the service, must
            be fulfilled before the account is completely deactivated.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            RideNow reserves the right to suspend or deactivate accounts in case of non-compliance with these terms,
            providing false or incomplete information, or any other action that compromises the integrity of the
            platform or the safety of its users.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>5.2. Trip Acceptance</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Drivers registered on the RideNow platform have the opportunity to accept rides requested by Riders based on
            their proximity to the pick-up point location. Upon receiving a trip request, the Rider can review the
            details provided, such as destination and estimated time, and decide whether to accept the ride. Once the
            request is accepted, the Driver must proceed to the pick-up point and complete the trip according to the
            terms set out on the platform.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            At the end of the trip, the corresponding payment will be automatically processed and credited to the
            driver&apos;s account associated with the platform. Drivers can access a detailed breakdown of their
            earnings directly from the app or the RideNow website. This breakdown includes information on individual
            earnings for each trip, as well as a daily and weekly summary that allows Drivers to keep accurate track of
            their earnings. In addition, the platform provides transparent information on fares charged and details of
            payments made, ensuring clarity and confidence in the compensation process.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Drivers are responsible for reviewing and updating their banking information to ensure that payments are
            processed correctly. In case of discrepancies or problems related to payments, Drivers may contact
            RideNow&apos;s support team for assistance. Furthermore, it is the obligation of Drivers to comply with the
            quality and service standards established by RideNow, providing safe and professional transportation to
            Riders.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            RideNow reserves the right to suspend or limit the access of Drivers who fail to comply with the terms and
            conditions or who fail to maintain a satisfactory level of service. By accepting a ride, Drivers agree to
            complete the ride in an efficient and ethical manner, contributing to the positive user experience on the
            platform.
          </p>

            <strong>5.3. Payments</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            As a Driver on the RideNow platform, you will receive payments for the transportation services you provide
            to Riders. These payments will be calculated based on the rates applicable to the trip, minus the RideNow
            Commission (see Commissions section). Tips given by Riders will be transferred in full to your account and
            will not be subject to any RideNow Commission. All payments will be processed through an authorized third
            party payment processor. You agree that amounts transferred to you will not include interest and will be
            subject to any legal holds required by applicable regulations. It is the Driver&apos;s responsibility to
            keep his/her bank account information up to date to ensure proper processing of payments.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>5.4. Commissions</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            By using the RideNow platform to offer your services, you agree to pay a Commission to RideNow for each
            transaction made. This Commission will be automatically deducted from the payments received for the services
            you provide. Specific details of the applicable Commission will be available in the Commission schedule
            provided to you through the Driver portal. RideNow reserves the right to change the Commission amount at any
            time based on local market conditions. In the event of any changes, RideNow will notify you in advance. Your
            continued use of the platform after notification of changes will constitute your acceptance of the changes.

          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>5.5. Pricing</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            You authorize RideNow to establish, on your behalf, the prices that will apply to the services you offer
            through the platform. These prices include the base rate, per mile and/or per minute charges, as well as any
            other adjustments that are part of the calculation of the Rates. RideNow reserves the right to modify the
            Fare schedule at any time, based on factors such as local market demand or specific conditions. In the event
            of changes to the applicable Fares, you will be notified in a timely manner. It is your responsibility to be
            aware of any modifications to ensure compliance with the platform&apos;s policies.

          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>5.6. Rate Adjustments</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            RideNow reserves the right to adjust or withhold part or all of the Fares in specific circumstances, such
            as:
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-8 list-inside list-disc">
            <li>If an attempt to defraud or abuse RideNow&apos;s system or its payment mechanisms is detected.</li>
            <li>
              To resolve a complaint filed by a Rider, such as taking an unnecessarily long route or not properly
              completing the ride in the application.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-8">
            These decisions will be made in a reasonable manner and based on available evidence. In case of adjustments
            or retentions, RideNow will inform you about the reasons and the amount affected, always acting in the
            interest of maintaining the integrity and trust in the platform.

          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            To use the RideNow platform as a Rider, users must create an account by providing basic information such as
            their name, phone number and email address. This registration is mandatory to access the platform&apos;s
            functionalities, such as requesting rides and communicating with Riders.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Users can register by downloading the RideNow mobile application and completing the registration form,
            accepting the corresponding terms and conditions. By registering, Riders declare that all information
            provided is accurate and truthful, and that they meet the legal requirements to use the service, such as
            being over 18 years of age or the legal age applicable in their jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The account created is strictly personal and non-transferable. Riders are responsible for maintaining the
            security of their login credentials and ensuring that their account is not used by third parties. Any
            activity carried out from the account is the responsibility of the account holder, who agrees to use the
            platform in a legal, ethical and compliant manner.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Riders may deactivate their account at any time by using the options available on the platform or by
            contacting RideNow customer service. However, they must resolve any outstanding obligations, such as
            payments associated with previous rides, before deactivation becomes effective.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            RideNow reserves the right to suspend or deactivate accounts in the event of non-compliance with the terms

            the experience of other users.

            <strong>6.2. Trip requests and bookings</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Riders can use the RideNow platform to request and book trips easily and quickly, adapting to their needs on
            the spot. To start the process, they only need to log into the application, indicate their pick-up point and
            destination, and confirm the request. The platform connects the Rider with an available driver in a matter
            of seconds. If they prefer to schedule a ride in advance, the “Schedule your ride” functionality allows them
            to set a specific date and time to ensure the availability of the service at the desired time.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Before confirming the trip, Riders can consult a fare estimate by entering their point of origin and
            destination. This gives them a clear idea of the approximate cost before proceeding with the request. Once
            the Rider accepts the trip, the platform provides all relevant information, such as the Rider&apos;s name,
            vehicle description (make and model), and contact details. In addition, Riders can track the real-time
            location of the Driver as the Driver makes his way to the pick-up point, with the option to give
            instructions to the Driver or communicate directly via messages or calls if needed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Upon arrival of the Driver, Riders simply board the vehicle and enjoy the ride to their destination. The
            platform automatically calculates the final fare and generates an invoice that will be available at the end
            of the trip. RideNow also offers additional features to enhance the user experience, such as the option to
            ride immediately or schedule for later, book a disabled-friendly ride, and even request a ride for someone
            else on their behalf.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            With these features, RideNow seeks to offer an efficient, accessible and convenient service tailored to the
            different needs of its users, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free ride experience. Riders should be sure to
            provide accurate details when requesting a ride to ensure that the service is carried out efficiently and
            satisfactorily.

            (“Charges”). These Charges include base fares, additional fares, tolls, surcharges, applicable taxes and any
            gratuities you choose to give to the Driver. RideNow reserves the sole right to set, modify and adjust the
            prices of the Services at any time, depending on factors such as demand, type of service requested and other
            conditions. As a user, you are solely responsible for all Charges incurred on your account, whether or not

            credit cards, debit cards, PayPal and wallet payments, depending on availability in each city or location
            where the platform is used. Users can securely configure their preferred payment method directly from their

          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            RideNow applies two main types of fares to trips: variable fares and quoted fares, each designed to
            accommodate different situations.
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-8 list-inside list-disc">
            <li>
              <strong>Variable fares:</strong> These fares are calculated by combining a base charge with increments
              based on the length and distance of the trip. In some cases, for particularly short trips, a minimum fare
              will be applied to ensure that the service is economically viable for the driver. Trip distance is
              measured using GPS data from the Driver&apos;s phone. However, due to technical limitations, such as loss

              the trip. This quote is subject to change prior to confirming the request. If the user changes the
              destination, makes multiple stops, or uses the platform inappropriately during the trip, the quoted fare
              may be replaced with a variable fare based on actual time and distance traveled. The quoted fare is
              intended to provide transparency, but does not guarantee equivalence to a variable fare on similar trips.

            During periods of high demand, RideNow may apply a multiplier to standard fares, known as the “Peak Hour
            Fare”. This multiplier reflects market conditions and seeks to balance supply and demand for the service.
            Before confirming your request, RideNow will make every effort to inform you of any multiplier in effect. In
            the case of quoted fares, the final price will include this adjustment. Peak hour fares ensure availability

            For each trip, RideNow may apply a “Service Fee”, which is intended to maintain and improve the
            infrastructure of the platform, as well as to cover associated operating costs. The amount of this fee may
            vary by city or region and is not passed on to the Driver. It is the responsibility of the users to review

            Once you request a ride, you may cancel it at any time through the app. However, in certain cases, such as
            last minute cancellations or no-shows at the pick-up point, RideNow may apply a cancellation fee. This fee
            is designed to compensate the Driver for the time and effort invested. Clients can view detailed

            If the Driver reports that you have caused significant property damage to his or her vehicle during a trip,
            you agree to pay a “Damage Fee”. This fee, which can be up to $250 depending on the damage, will be assessed
            and determined by RideNow. The platform reserves the right to verify the damage through documentation,
            photographs or other evidence before processing the charge. The amount collected will be transferred in full

            Credits and discounts only apply to base fares and do not cover other charges. If the cost of trip exceeds

            pre-authorizations when adding a new payment method or making a request. Although these authorizations do
            not constitute a charge, they may temporarily reduce the available credit on your bank account. Users are
            responsible for any additional charges, such as overdrafts, resulting from these authorizations. RideNow is
            not responsible for these costs and recommends contacting the issuing bank for more information on such

            manner. RideNow acts only as an intermediary in this process and is not responsible for the loss, damage or
            return of forgotten items.

          <p className="mb-8">
            If any section of these terms is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
            enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired. Our failure to

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">20. FORCE MAJEURE</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            RideNow shall not be liable for any failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control,
            including, without limitation, fortuitous events, acts of civil authorities, acts of military authorities,
            riots, embargoes, acts of nature and natural disasters, and other acts that may be due to unforeseen

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">21. TERMINATION</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Both the user and RideNow acknowledge that failure to comply with these terms and conditions may result in
            termination of the agreement between both parties.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            <strong>In case of non-compliance by the user:</strong> If the user fails to comply with any of the terms
            set forth in these terms and conditions, RideNow reserves the right to unilaterally terminate the
            user&apos;s access to and use of the platform. RideNow may take this action without prior notice, and the
            User will automatically lose all rights to access and use the platform. Furthermore, RideNow shall not be
            liable for any loss of data or information associated with the user&apos;s account.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            <strong>In case of non-compliance by RideNow:</strong> If RideNow fails to comply with its obligations under
            the agreed terms and conditions, the User shall be entitled to terminate the agreement and stop using the
            platform. The user shall notify RideNow in writing of the breach and allow a reasonable time for RideNow to
            remedy the situation. If RideNow does not remedy the breach within the set period, the user may proceed with
            the termination of the agreement.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Termination of the agreement shall not release either party from any obligations and liabilities that have
            arisen prior to the date of termination.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Continued use of the platform after termination of the agreement by either party shall imply acceptance of
            the conditions set forth in the terms and conditions in effect at that time.
          </p>
          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">22. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Any dispute, claim or controversy arising between a user and RideNow in connection with these terms and
            conditions, the use of the platform or the services provided, shall be resolved exclusively through
            alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, including mediation and arbitration, as detailed below.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            First, both parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve any dispute informally. This includes direct
            communication between the parties involved to identify and address concerns or disagreements quickly and
            efficiently. Users may contact RideNow through designated support channels to raise any disputes. The
            company commits to respond within a reasonable period of time, providing an opportunity to resolve the issue
            without resorting to formal procedures.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            If the parties fail to resolve the dispute informally within thirty (30) days of initial notification of the
            dispute, the dispute will be submitted to mediation. The mediation shall be conducted before a neutral
            mediator selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator
            within an additional fifteen (15) days, a mediator shall be appointed through a recognized mediation agency.
            The costs of the mediation shall be shared equally between the parties, and the mediation shall be conducted
            in English and at a mutually agreed location or, if both parties agree, through a virtual platform.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            If mediation does not result in a mutually satisfactory resolution, the dispute shall be resolved by binding
            arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association
            (AAA) or a similar internationally recognized body. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral
            arbitrator, who shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the arbitration body. The place of
            arbitration shall be in the city of Orlando, Florida, USA. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve the dispute, including determining the
            applicability and validity of these dispute resolution terms. The arbitrator&apos;s decision shall be final
            and binding on both parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Unless
            prohibited by applicable law, the parties agree to waive any right to bring the dispute in court or to
            participate in a class action.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            This dispute resolution clause does not preclude RideNow from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in the
            event of intellectual property rights infringement, misuse of the platform, or any act that may cause
            irreparable harm, in which case it may go directly to a court of competent jurisdiction without exhausting
            alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            By accepting these terms, users expressly waive any right to a jury trial and agree that all disputes will
            be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this clause, with the objective of minimizing the
            costs and time associated with formal litigation. The parties assume their own costs associated with
            mediation and arbitration, unless otherwise agreed or specifically provided by the arbitrator.
          </p>
          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">23. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">

            binding arbitration is agreed to in the applicable section.

            conditions by us at any time shall not constitute a waiver of our rights to enforce such provision, or any
