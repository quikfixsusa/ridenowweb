            Cookies are small text files that websites store on the user&apos;s device (computer, smartphone, tablet)
            when browsing the internet. These cookies contain information that allows websites to remember user
            preferences, improve the browsing experience and, in some cases, track online activity for analytical or
            advertising purposes. There are several types of cookies, such as session cookies, which are deleted when
            the browser is closed, and persistent cookies, which remain on the device for a defined period. Cookies are
            essential to personalize the user experience and improve the functionality of the website.

          <p className="mb-8">
            Although we believe that our legitimate interests in using cookies do not outweigh your fundamental rights
            and freedoms, you still have the choice to refuse or manage the use of cookies through your browser settings
            or by using the tools available on our website.

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">6. STORAGE DURATION OF COOKIES</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The cookies used on our website have different retention periods depending on their purpose. Necessary
            cookies, which are essential for the basic operation of the site, are stored only for the time necessary to
            provide the services requested, such as secure access to restricted areas or user authentication. These
            cookies cannot be disabled, as without them the website would not function properly.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Functionality cookies, which allow us to remember your preferences, such as language or personalized site
            settings, may have a variable duration. Some of these cookies may be session cookies, meaning that they are
            deleted when you close your browser, while others may be stored for longer periods, up to several years, to
            provide a smooth and consistent user experience on repeat visits.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Analytical cookies allow us to track activity on the website to improve its performance and the user
            experience. These cookies are kept for a maximum of 24 months before being automatically deleted. You can
            manage or delete these cookies at any time through your browser settings. However, by disabling or deleting
            these cookies, some functionality of the site may be limited, which could affect your browsing experience.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            In addition, there are cookies that can be classified in the ‘other’ category, which include those that do
            not fit directly into the above categories but are used for other specific purposes, such as improving
            security or analyzing the more detailed use of the website. These cookies have different durations and, like
            analytics cookies, can be managed or deleted at the user&apos;s discretion through browser settings.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Please note that deleting or rejecting cookies may adversely affect the functionality of the site and may

            If you do not want cookies to be dropped on your device, you can adjust the setting of your Internet browser
